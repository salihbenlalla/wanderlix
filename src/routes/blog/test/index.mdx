If you plan to visit Riquewihr, then you should start with Rue du Général de Gaulle. This street starts at the foot of the Hotel de Ville, dated 1808, and goes to the Dolder, the former belfry of the city.

### 2\. The Dolder

At the end of the rue du Général de Gaulle is one of the emblematic monuments to visit in Riquewihr. The Dolder was once the entrance door of the city.

Built at the same time as the wall in the 13th century, it was once used to defend the city thanks to its watch tower installed on the belfry. Dolder means in Alsatian "the highest point".

It now houses in three of its floors the local museum of Art and Popular Tradition. Here you can admire a collection of weapons from the 15th and 17th century, various tools and objects related to winemaking professions, documents and family memories.

The monument finally gives a good insight into the solidity of the ramparts of the time!

As mentioned above, Riquewihr has several castles. This Château de Bilstein unfortunately did not survive the times or wars that the region has experienced.
